# Flow:
Create a Game or Join a game (with a code? or just one lobby?)

## Create a Game
has various options (see below)
then you create a lobby and can see people with a name (kahoot style)

### word wolf 
- each person has a turn to suggest two words for the rest of the lobby [wordmaster]
- if you want to suggest more for the queue you can
- if you don't have any ideas you can autogenerate from a bank
- if you don't have any ideas, you can also just let the next one from the queue go in if it exists
- a timer will run for x amount of minutes for discussion time
- then you spend another timer amount to vote people out
- then u select/poll your votes, majority wins (amongus style)
- if no concensus reached, keep going
- game ends when overall game time runs out (so imposter survives), or when imposter is voted out?
- maybe game ends when the majority think they voted out the imposter (so after each eject, if majority thinks mole is gone the game ends)

### Paranoia
- each person suggests a question (or selects from the bank)
- the question has to relate to the people within the group/game
- randomly selects the person you're talking/giving the question to (and you know it)
- You know who told you your question and pick a name.
- The name is displayed for the lobby.
- After a name is chosen it is randomly decided to reveal the question (can be cool animation automated, or manually inputted by the gamemaster (me))
- question will/will not be displayed to the lobby (with the asker and the answerer)
- we keep going for x amount of rounds
- or a timer
- round ends when everyone asks and answers a question

- maybe rounds/pacing could be in two phases: you ask and answer a question to your randomly assigned people in the answering phase, then there will be a vote-off phase where the question/answer pairs will randomly be/not be revealed
- in this case, maybe get the people involved in the pairing to stand up and point to their selected group member (to make it more interactive)
- then the random reveal flip plays, or is manually done by gamemaster


## Weird cases
- people lose connection/close app
- new people join mid way
- people double up on the same device
