# Flow:
Create a Game or Join a game (with a code? or just one lobby?)

## Create a Game
has various options (see below)
then you create a lobby and can see people with a name (kahoot style)

Can run a one-device game where you take turns answering on the same device (good for showcasing this game program)

### word wolf 
CASUAL VERSION:
ideal for less than a certain amount of people
words are chosen from a bank of questions

prompts/hints are randomly displayed/cycled through through a bank as well as you play

GROUP VERSION:
- each person has a turn to suggest two words for the rest of the lobby [wordmaster]
- if you want to suggest more for the queue you can
- if you don't have any ideas you can autogenerate from a bank
- if you don't have any ideas, you can also just let the next one from the queue go in if it exists
- a timer will run for x amount of minutes for discussion time
- then you spend another timer amount to vote people out
- then u select/poll your votes, majority wins (amongus style)
- if no concensus reached, keep going
- game ends when overall game time runs out (so imposter survives), or when imposter is voted out?
- maybe game ends when the majority think they voted out the imposter (so after each eject, if majority thinks mole is gone the game ends)

prompts/hints are randomly displayed/cycled through through a bank as well as you play


### Paranoia
- each person suggests a question (or selects from the bank)
- the question has to relate to the people within the group/game
- randomly selects the person you're talking/giving the question to (and you know it)
- You know who told you your question and pick a name.
- The name is displayed for the lobby.
- After a name is chosen it is randomly decided to reveal the question (can be cool animation automated, or manually inputted by the gamemaster (me))
- question will/will not be displayed to the lobby (with the asker and the answerer)
- we keep going for x amount of rounds
- or a timer
- round ends when everyone asks and answers a question

- maybe rounds/pacing could be in two phases: you ask and answer a question to your randomly assigned people in the answering phase, then there will be a vote-off phase where the question/answer pairs will randomly be/not be revealed
- in this case, maybe get the people involved in the pairing to stand up and point to their selected group member (to make it more interactive)
- then the random reveal flip plays, or is manually done by gamemaster

## BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY (Pictionary)
Can suggest words in the lobby to the queue, else it randomly selects a word/topic from a bank

Take turns drawing (otherwise you're a guesser)
Just generates a random pictionary word

Drawer has to try and communicate this word/idea/concept to the guessers BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY (except verbally saying it of course)
The game itself just displays a word, so irl/off the application game itself the drawer will need to communicate this word to the rest of the group

Guessers should try and be fast - they should try and type the word out 
guesses which are similar in spelling notify them to check their spelling
Guessers who guess first earn some good points


End of the game is rounds or time or until queue runs out
Awards to best guesser [guesses the most words fastest]
Awards to best drawer [people guessed their words fast/the most]
Awards to best overall player (points system)


## Weird cases
- people lose connection/close app
- new people join mid way
- people double up on the same device
